lets finish this project!

## Todo for demo
- [X] Finish game
- [X] Timing Analysis
- [ ] clean up code (make code pretty! see if there's a linter for vhdl)
- [ ] Finish testbenches
  - [ ] fix score tb
  - [ ] fix kb_mapper tb
  - [ ] fix pixel generator tb
  - [ ] simulation of integration testbench
  - [ ] testbench where a tank shoots another tank, and collision_check works 
  - [ ] Script testbenches together?
  - [ ] Verify that testbench with just tank and bullet still works
